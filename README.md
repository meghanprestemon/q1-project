This website is focused on helping you get motivated and giving you the tools to be successful in becoming active.

The first thing this website offers is the ability for the user to generate random motivational quotes provided by the Forismatic API. After each new quote is generated, the user if given the option to tweet the quote using the 'tweet button'.

The home page also allows the user to locate yoga studios near their current location or search for studios elsewhere. The Google Places and Google Maps APIs makes this possible.

There is also a 'videos' page that allows the user to watch yoga videos embedded from YouTube.

The entire website is styled using Bootstrap with Bootswatch's free theme 'Sandstone'.
